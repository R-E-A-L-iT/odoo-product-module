			<p id="hardware">New features and bug fixes to the firmware are constantly being worked on and updates
		 	are typically available every few months. It's also important to keep your instrument running 
		 	smoothly with servicing and calibration. Some of your customers may even require that you have 
		 	a recent calibration certificate to prove your instrument is functioning properly. Having a CCP
			also gives you access to technical support for the product. Further options allow you to extend
		   	your warranty (BRONZE, SILVER, and GOLD) and the GOLD CCPs include a free loaner instrument while
		    your instrument is down or away on repair/calibration.</p>

			<h4>WHY RENEW YOUR SOFTWARE CCP?</h4>
			<div class="red-div"/>
			<p>New features and bug fixes are constantly being worked on and updates to our software are available
			every few months. It's also important to keep all your products up to date together as they may stop 
			working properly if some are renewed and others aren't. Having a CCP also gives you access to technical
			support for the product.</p>
			<h2>
				Software Subscriptions
			</h2>
			<h4>WHY RENEW YOUR SOFTWARE Subscriptions?</h4>
			<div class="red-div"/>
			<p>New features and bug fixes are constantly being released and updates to our software are released several
				times a year. It is also important to keep all your products up to date together as they may stop working properly
				if some are renewed and others are not. A subscription gives you the possibility to be up to date and have access
				to the software at all times until the expiry of the subscription. If the product is not renewed, you lose access
				to this software on the expiration date.
				<br/>
				In the "Additional subscriptions" section, you can choose to add products and their quantities. In the
				“Existing subscriptions” section, you can choose whether or not to renew the products you already have.</p>
